#first function that prints the return value from the second function
#work: 
#   Step1:Call the second fuction passing one argument.
#   Step2:Get the return value from second function and print the value.

#second function that returns each number from 1 to 100 by replacing the number with fizz or buzz or fizzbuzz
#input (parameters) = 1 number from 1 to 100
#work:
#	Step1: check whether the number is between 1 to 100.
#	Step2: check whether the number is divisible by both 3 &5.
#	Step3: check whether the number is divisible only by 3.
#	Step4: check whether the number is divisible only by 5.
#output (return) = fizz or buzz or fizzbuzz or number itself
